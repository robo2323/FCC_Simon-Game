# Simon Game

### [Live Demo](https://robo2323.github.io/FCC_Simon-Game)

A project from the [Free Code Camp](https://freecodecamp.org) front-end curriculum based on the classic [Simon game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game))

Created with vanilla **JavaScript** and **LESS/CSS** using CSS transforms with 
```CSS
{transform-style: preserve-3d}
```
to create a Faux-3D effect.
